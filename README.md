# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course and represents the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

The website demonstrates the implementation of a booking application for the Little Lemon website. It was built using React components to showcase my understanding of React for web development. Additionally, it incorporates API calls to enhance functionality.

Please note: The only fully functional feature on this website, aside from the design, is the "Reserve a Table" function.

## Screenshots
Here are some screeenshots of the application showcasing the Booking functionality.
